SonarQube and Jenkins are both tools used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of software projects. SonarQube is a static code analysis tool that can be used to find bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in the source code of a software project. Jenkins, on the other hand, is a automation server that can be used to automate various tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software.

While SonarQube can be used independently of Jenkins, it is often used in combination with Jenkins to provide automated code analysis as part of the CI/CD pipeline. In this setup, Jenkins is responsible for building, testing, and deploying the software, This allows developers to quickly identify and fix any issues in their code, ensuring that the software is of high quality and free of defects.
