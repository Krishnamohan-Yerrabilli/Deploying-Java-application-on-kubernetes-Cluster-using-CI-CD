Jenkins is an open-source automation tool written in Java with many built-in <br>
plugins for continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) purposes.  <br>
It is primarily used to automate tasks related to efficiently building, testing,  <br>
deploying and maintaining your project. You can integrate Jenkins with version  <br>
control tools like GitLab, Bitbucket, Github where you can automatically build,  <br>
test and deploy your code whenever you commit it. 

Google Compute Engine (in GCP): These are configured virtual machines running in <br>
Google data centers with access to high-performance networking infrastructure and <br>
block storage. You can choose different types of storage disks such as standard HDDs, <br>
SSDs, local SSDs or a combination of different disks.
